Objective:

1. Research on payment based mobile applications (Android and IOS marketplace - India) in order to derive a rubric of design    constraints (gamify) and identify pressing needs that could be solved with mobile businesses.

2. Ideation based on the opportunity spaces identified and shortlisting of two business plans.

3. Design, road testing, marketing and implementation plan for the two apps.


 
Role: Design Intern at the Technology Innovation Cell, Yes Bank Ltd.
Supervisor: Chief Innovation Officer, Yes Bank Ltd. 


The two applications that were eventually shortlisted and turned into mobile-payment based business models are,

1. M-Ticket - An application through which commuters on the Mumbai locals (Western, Central and Harbour lines) can purchase railway tickets. Trains in Mumbai face a staggering volume of everyday commuters and buying a ticket physically is an ordeal. The app addresses this problem.

2. Get Set Grow - The busy lifestyles of city based families show a widening gap between the lives of parents and their children. The need for various solutions to address this gap is paramount. Get Set Grow is a smart-parenting app to keep track of tasks assigned to their children, personal and educational.

This was a concept that I built at Angelhack (Team of 3).

I asked myself the question,
"What if you had Harry Potter zooming around on his broom, floating over the pages when you were reading the book?”


Made using: Unity3d, Vuforia plugin and cloud, C#.


We recieved overwhelming positive user feedback in this case and were declared the winners of the hackathon among 60 teams.
















This video shows the prototype.


As the book is opened, on the right there’s text and on the left there’s a battle scene being played out to make an immersive experience.

		<div>Augmented Storytelling
</div>
		<div>UNGLI (‘The finger’)</div>
		<div>
Ungli (“The Finger”) was born out of personally witnessing multiple incidents of children and less previleged youths being mistreated and manhandled in public. Bystander effect is quite common in these cases - as such incidents have sunk into the psyche of the society as an everyday occurance. These are the crimes that we define as 'those which people see, momentarily rile against in their internal monologue, but do nothing about as they slip back into their everyday lives'.

The research conducted by a team of 3 (including myself) to explore the possiblity of citizen sourced crime reporting. The desired outcome is for a society to become aware of its internal dysfunctions and act against them, however discreetly.

Ungli - the business plan figured under Eureka 2015, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

Problem Statement:

Playscapes are diminishing due to the effects of urbanisation limiting space, diminishing due to the infusion of substitutes in the form of technology (quote: touch-screens. internet, mobile phones). 

Problem statement naturally follows: “How to infuse technology in a synergetic manner to help assist (networked) playscapes in order to bring more people together to have a playful experience?”.


Synchronous walk is an outdoor installation that innocuously tickles people’s curiosity and brings them together. When two people walk with their footfalls in sync on the plates (as seen in the picture), nothing happens. If not, there’s a startling announcement on the speaker. 

At MIT Media Labs workshop 2015.

		<div>Design Process
Day 1: Immersion into what makes a networked playscape
Questions asked:
What defines a playscape?
What are the parameters of a playful experience?
What unlimited potentials does technology offer?

Brainstorming on the parameters to be observed.
Playscapes involve the following three category of elements and how each affects the other.
1. Space - based 
2. Object - based 
3. People - based
   
Day 2: Field visitPlaces visited:
1. Huge unmaintained cricket playground where many of the community members come and play usually
2. Riverfront park
3. Step-well - a monument constructed around a well - a social gathering place
4. Flea market: Full of trinkets and hacking stuff

Day 3: Consolidation of previous day’s experience and brainstorming on ideas. Concept playscape (chart)
Day 4: Idea shortlisting and rough prototype 

Day 5: Validation of need, field visit: An children's school with design focus and abundant playareas.
 Children offer feedback on the idea and infuse new thoughts.

Day 5 afternoon: Changes based on feedback, Circuit design, planks building etc.

Day 6: Installation of the networked playscape.</div>
