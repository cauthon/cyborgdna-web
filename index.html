		<div>Muthu holds Graduate courses in Creative Problem Solving, Digital Business Entrepreneurship and Electronic Markets, Masters in Business Design and Bachelors in Bioinformatics.

His perennial focus is towards creativity, cognitive sciences and problem solving mental models. His experience has endowed him with an intuitive sense of creative direction and interdisciplinary skills spanning various sciences.

An avid reader and writer of science fiction and psychology, in his spare time, he participates in hackathons and various design workshops.</div>

The interdisciplinary nature of human interaction that is required to create evolutionary changes of the future, neccessitates a data driven approach to information and problem solving based on open source fundamentals.

With the turn of the 21st Century we see a growing convergence among various scientific fields of enquiry and naturally there exists a need for curated data that derives exponential value when transcribed across disciplines. 

CYBORGDNA, takes the Design Thinking approach towards achieving such technological singularity by building on systematically patterned, cognitive pockets of actionable knowledge across the web.

		<div>Aditi holds academic qualifications in Military Sciences, Chemical and Embedded Systems and is pursuing her second bachelors’ in Cognitive Sciences and Clinical Psychology.

Her tendencies wax towards precocious forecasting (yes, we noticed the grammatical error), edgy pieces of art and a flair for the comically macabre.

Her experience has endowed her with a disturbing sense of humor and an ability to have a plan of action for almost everything under the sun

Toyota Production System: - {make anything efficient design process}

1. Make a lean production strategy
2. Make the processes into a system - Design
3. Establish flow between cells
4. Establish Pull between cells
5. Strive for perfection.


1. Lean Strategy

create urgency
sell lean /TPS throughout enterprise
hire a sensei to retain design talent
reduce people (by automation & retain trust)
address the supply issues - preliminary thought to the nature of suppliers
consider the competitive environment


2. Design System

customer base - product range
Time and range of conversation to output flow. (ratio)
create axiomatic design
eliminate non-essential infrastructure and layers.


3. Establish Flow

Cells based on talking time {Department communication flow}
Set standards for operations between system areas
judoka - separate worker from machine
Develop quick set ups and standard WIPs (SMED)
Standardise operations

4. Establish Pull between cells

Design information system to produce only products needed by the downstream cells (American economy ;)
Incorporate talk time to drive flows
Institute levelled production -heijunka
Use visual control systems
Implement total productive maintenance


5. Strive for perfection

kaizen and 5s
transfer ownership of all processes to work force
push lean down to suppliers! (make them what you once were)
integrate product development to ever diverging areas of the system
reduce people at all levels of the organisation.
